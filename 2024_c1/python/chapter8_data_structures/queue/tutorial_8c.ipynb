    "Define a function named `stackToQueue`.  \n",
    "This function expects a stack as an argument. The function builds and returns an instance of `LinkedQueue` that contains the elements in the stack. The function assumes that the stack has the interface described in the previous stack section. The function’s postconditions are that the stack is left in the same state as it was before the function was called, and that the queue’s front element is the one at the top of the stack."
